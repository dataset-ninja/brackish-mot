**BrackishMOT: The Brackish Multi-Object Tracking Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the environmental research, and in the fishery industry. 

The dataset consists of 76618 images with 894800 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *small fish*, *crab*, *starfish*, and other: *fish*, *shrimp*, and *jellyfish*.

Images in the BrackishMOT dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 10570 (14% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (73131 images) and *test* (3487 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 images types: ***synthetic*** (60000 images) and ***real*** (16618 images), or into 8 conditions of synthetic environment: ***plain background, no turbidity, no distractors*** (7500 images), ***plain background, no turbidity, with distractors*** (7500 images), ***plain background, turbidity, no distractors*** (7500 images), ***plain background, with turbidityand distractors*** (7500 images), ***video background, no turbidity, no distractors*** (7500 images), ***video background with distractor, but no turbidity*** (7500 images), ***video background with turbidity and distractors*** (7500 images), and ***video background with turbidity, but without distractors*** (7500 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence*** tag, labels marked with ***target id***. Explore its in Supervisely labelling tool.
